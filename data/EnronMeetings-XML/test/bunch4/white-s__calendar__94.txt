<true_name> Stacey:

 </true_name> I received your name from <true_name> David Oliver  </true_name> in London, who mentioned that you may be able to answer questions for me regarding how we handle tolling for power in relation to order handling.    I am a business analyst working with EIM on the Logistics project.

I would like to ask some questions on this to understand how my team might relate it to the steel industry for EIM.

Let me know if this time will work for you.  If not, I can reschedule.

Thanks,
<true_name> Angela </true_name>
