I've checked your calendars and this time looks good for most of you.

Please let me know if you can attend.  We don't have a room scheduled yet, we'll let you know as soon as we get one.

Best regards

As a follow up to <true_name> Sally' </true_name> s staff meeting today, I was asked to set up a meeting for <true_name> Sally' </true_name> s direct reports + the curve validation task force to discuss roles and responsibilities around curve validation.  I've checked your calendars and this is the only time all of you are available.

As a background for those of you not on the task force,

To date, the task force has concentrated on:
-  putting business requirements around the tools needed perform the curve vals
-  determining a methodology for curve validation
- determining what should be scoped in and out of curve vals

What is still left to resolve and/or has not been touched on is:
- who should be responsible for performing the different facets of the validations
- how active RAC's role should be in the process
- a validation of benchmark conversion factors
- a validation of correlation factors

Look forward to seeing you there.
