All,

We had a business review of the ERCOT Volume Management processes this morning and decided we should tag up with scheduling and trading prior to or review with ESCA on Wednesday.  The objective of this meeting on Tuesday is to review a systems drawing provided to us from ESCA.  We can make additions/modifications to the drawing to review with ESCA during our Wednesday meeting.  

I will send out the systems drawing by COB today.   

Please let me know if you have any questions/comments or you would like to add others to the meeting.  

Thank you.
