"Power price modeling plays an important part in power option pricing, power plant valuation and outage insurance premium calculation.  Over the years, we have developed different approaches to this problem.  Each approach may have its advantages and limitations.  Choosing a different model becomes a balanced act between robustness and accuracy.

On the other hand, Research needs to set a standard for power price modeling.  In the proposed meeting, we need to discuss and make a recommendation on the unified "Research Model for Power Prices".
