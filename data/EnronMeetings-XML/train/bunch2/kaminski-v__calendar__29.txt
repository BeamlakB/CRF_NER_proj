I have communicated to them that we are taking a fresh look at all our scoring 
vendors.  Based upon Moody's acquisition of Famas/LAE, I told them I would like 
to hear their product suite "vision" for a customer such as ENE.  I emphasized 
our interest in predictive power of any model(s), and requirement for 
mapability to Moody's/S&P/Enron ratings based upon historical default rates.
