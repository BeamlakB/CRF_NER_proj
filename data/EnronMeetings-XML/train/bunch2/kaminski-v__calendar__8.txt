Folks,
I'm starting to go through withdrawals from not seeing all of you, from lack of stimulating conversation, and of course good food and drink.  So please check with your better half and let me know if you can make our next scheduled EDF meeting.

Hope to see you soon,

<true_name> Craig </true_name>
