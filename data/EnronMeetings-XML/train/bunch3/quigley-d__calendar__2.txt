Surveyors Comments were Uniform"Creative, innovative and oh-so-noisy" is the consensus on this Contemporary Creole "jewel of the Warehouse District", the flagship of celeb chef <true_name> Emeril Lagasse,  </true_name> that draws the "hip, young and cool" (plus plenty of tourists) with its "amazing food" and "energy level"; but even some admirers complain that stardom has led to sometimes "haughty service" and that the kitchen "suffers" when the "bam man" is out of town -"<true_name> Emeril </true_name> , please phone home."
