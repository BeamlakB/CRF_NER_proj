All, 
Per <true_name> Fletch </true_name> , 2:30 seems to work for today's meeting.  TJ will send the room number around.  I've put together a short agenda and presentation to work from.  It'd probably be useful if everyone would bring information from the various customer lists we've been working on, as well as ideas on product offerings.
 
Thanks,
<true_name> Dale
