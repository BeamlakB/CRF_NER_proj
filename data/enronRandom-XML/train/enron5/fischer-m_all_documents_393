In order to expedite the speed of network response in the days when we had 
hubs instead of switches IT/Spohn set up the cabling between my computer and 
<true_name> Mark Fisher </true_name> 's computer and the network servers so they didn't go through the 
hub like they did for all other users.    In the current rewiring of the 
building will <true_name> Mark  </true_name> and I be changed to a cabling configuration more typical 
of all other users down here?   This info will help us do limited elimination 
of causes for network problems before we call IT with future problems.
