<true_name> Laura </true_name> , I spoke to <true_name> Tom  </true_name> about his retail proposals, I told him that you would 
coordinate a meeting between <true_name> Mark Muller </true_name> /<true_name> Lou Pai  </true_name> and himself.  I only want 
<true_name> Lou  </true_name> going up if <true_name> Tom  </true_name> is involved.  However, <true_name> Mark Muller  </true_name> is up to go and I have 
spoken to him with regard to the opportunity today.  He is expecting your 
call.

On a related note, I volunteered <true_name> Wes Colwell  </true_name> (our controller and former 
Anderson person) to speak to Peoples accounting/ risk people and Anderson 
auditors on how to manage the issues surrounding marking the hub values 
inside Peoples.  I would appreciate you coordinating that meeting.  If <true_name> Wes 
 </true_name> goes to Chicago, we want to ensure Leubbers, the Anderson folks and the 
appropriate Peoples accounting folks are available so <true_name> Wes  </true_name> can spend the least 
amount of time on this issue.

<true_name> Jeff </true_name> , where are we on the PECO/PSEG retail play that you spoke to <true_name> Mark Muller 
 </true_name> about a couple weeks back?

<true_name> Mark </true_name> , I forgot to mention that FPL is interested in potentially investing in 
the New Power Company - <true_name> Tony Altman  </true_name> (President of FPL wholesale) would like 
to discuss.  If interested please call him at 561-625-7777.  If you don't 
think you will have any interest let me know and I will call him to let him 
know.  I probably need to get back to him either way shortly. Thanks.

Regards
<true_name> Delainey </true_name>
