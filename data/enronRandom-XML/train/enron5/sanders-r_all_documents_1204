<true_name> Veronica </true_name> ,

I spoke with Pittsburgh Corning about our current month natural gas 
receivables. Per <true_name> Harry Fleming </true_name> , they have filed Chapter 11 and are in court. 
He transferred me to <true_name> Jill Kio  </true_name> who informed me that they submitted Enron's 
invoice for payment before they filed so they do not expect to delay payment. 
However, as they do not know what the outcome of court will be, they can not 
promise the payment will NOT be delayed.

<true_name> Jill  </true_name> is faxing me some paperwork on their filings and I will forward that to 
you upon receipt. If you have any questions, please do not hestitate to call.
