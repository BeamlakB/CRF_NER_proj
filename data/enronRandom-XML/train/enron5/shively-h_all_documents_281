<true_name> Laura

 </true_name> <true_name> Dave Forster  </true_name> from Eol may be calling you.  I am trying to get the Hub online 
and I am having trouble because Enron does not own more than 50% of the 
Midwest Hub.  An EOL lawyer may have found a solution.  I have asked <true_name> Dave  </true_name> to 
call you.  I wanted to give you a heads up.  

Thanks
