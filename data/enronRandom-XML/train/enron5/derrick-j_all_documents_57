Hi <true_name> James </true_name> :

My name is <true_name> Pat Brandt  </true_name> and I work for the Legal Research Center ("LRC") in
Minneapolis.  As you may know, we are the nation's leading provider of
outsourced legal research and writing services.  Recently, we have entered
into a strategic business alliance with Integrity Interactive Corporation
("IIC"), to offer industry-leading, online compliance training - training
that could help Enron save millions in the event of a DOJ prosecution.
LRC's role in this alliance is to provide the legal research content for the
compliance courses and assist in the marketing and selling of the IIC
product.

You can view our compliance modules at work or home, as long as you have
access to the internet and a personal access code.  To receive an access
code or more information, please call (800-776-9377) or send me a reply
email.  Thank you for your time and have a great day!

Sincerely,

<true_name> Patrick C. Brandt </true_name> , Esq.
