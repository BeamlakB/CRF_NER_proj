Hi <true_name> Hillary </true_name> , hope you are well.  Unfortunately, I won't be able to make it 
tomorrow.  I just couldn't work out the schedule, but it was extremely 
thoughtful of you to invite me.  I hope you have a great time.....(I'll send 
something to <true_name> Ben  </true_name> in the gallery tomorrow)...

Best,

<true_name> Jeff
