<true_name> Mary </true_name> ,

I have been unsuccessful at finding your phone number so I will try this 
email address I received from <true_name> Kim Olinger </true_name> .  I have recently moved from 
Enron's Portland office where I worked for <true_name> Chris Foster </true_name> , to Houston to 
re-initiate our gas marketing efforts in the west.  <true_name> Chris  </true_name> has been turning 
over the gas responsibilities he retained after moving to Portland.  Could 
you change the Enron contact that you have in your system from <true_name> Chris Foster 
 </true_name> to me?  My name is <true_name> Kim Ward  </true_name> and my number is 713-853-0685.  Please call me 
with any questions you might have. 

Thanks,

<true_name> Kim Ward </true_name>
