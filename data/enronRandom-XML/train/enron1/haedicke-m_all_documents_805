FYI, <true_name> Mark Haedicke  </true_name> from Legal informed me that there is some sort of conflict 
and consequently legal concerns over hiring <true_name> John Bloomer  </true_name> as outside 
consultant.  As a contract with him would probably not be approved by Legal 
we won't further pursue to hire him for our technical due diligence.
