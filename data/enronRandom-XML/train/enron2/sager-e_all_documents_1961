<true_name> Bill  </true_name> and <true_name> Tracy </true_name> ,

<true_name> Elizabeth </true_name> , <true_name> Shari  </true_name> and I  have gone over the three part exposure reducing trade 
idea together internally, and are going to review it with our outside 
counsel, <true_name> Ken Raisler </true_name> , before giving you our definitive comments on the merits 
or demerits of the proposed structure.  Unfortunately <true_name> Ken  </true_name> is out until Monday 
and unavailable by phone.  If all goes well Monday,  we will have something 
to you by the end of the day or maybe on Tuesday. ----cgy
