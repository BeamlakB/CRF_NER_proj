We will receive the signed copy of Gas Natural Mexico today, I''ll let you 
know as soon as I receive it.
Also we need to send them executables copies for Comercializadora Metrogas, 
they only have now a draft, but they can sign it very fast because it is 
alrready aproved by they attorneys.

<true_name> Paul Radous  </true_name> will prepare a credit worksheet for the new company, Gas Natural 
Servicios, S.A. de C.V.

Good News,

The ISDA has been approved and will be signed when the CEO return from 
holydays (Jan 8). They will sign the 2 ISDA's we sent for Gas Natural Mexico 
and Comercializadora Metrogas, and also want to sign another for Gas Natural 
Servicios.

They will send me the corporate documents for this company, I will forward 
them as soon as I receive them.

<true_name> Paul </true_name> , please tell us if we can use the same format of ISDA as in 
Comercializadora Metrogas, they are going to provide the same guaranty from 
Gas Natural Mexico.

Regards,
