Only other issue I can think of, is making sure that deals with "I" risk do 
not show up in V@R calculation (Only deals with M gas daily risk should be 
downloaded into risktrac for V@R).

Subject: Gas Daily Issue

<true_name> Geoff  </true_name> visited with me this morning regarding the Gas Daily Issue and I 
attempted to summarize this in the attached document.  If you get a chance 
before tomorrow's meeting, could you review this and see if I missed any 
major pieces?  (Just look at the First Tab that says Gas Daily, the TDS tab 
is nothing at this point.)  <true_name> Geoff  </true_name> said he had talked this through with you so 
I thought you may recognize if I missed anything or misunderstood it.  (I 
also left a copy of it on his desk.)  Thanks.
