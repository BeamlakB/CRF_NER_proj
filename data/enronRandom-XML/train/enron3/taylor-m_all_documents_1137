I am not sure if <true_name> Christian  </true_name> got back with you on the possible timing for our 
legal seminar in Portland but <true_name> Tim Belden  </true_name> is out until Friday and <true_name> Christian  </true_name> is 
out until Monday.  <true_name> Christian  </true_name> indicated to me that he was going to call you on 
Monday with a definitive date.  

The web site is now available outside the firewall.  The location is 
http://www.enronwest.com    Be aware that this is currently only a template 
site. 

Let me know if you need any additional information.

Regards,
