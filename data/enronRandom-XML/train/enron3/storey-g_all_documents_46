Please see the attached file for the revised inception document. I would

Comments:

<true_name> Zhiyong Wei  </true_name> to be added to signature lists.
Timeline to include production dates - ie include UAT and production roll-out 
dates.
Dependencies - where there are dependencies on other groups (any interaction 
required with any group outside of Zheiyong's), these need to be highlighted 
and a representative from that group needs to sign off on that portion of the 
timeline ( a representative can not be below Director level in the 
organiztion).

There are clearly many people rolling off early in this project who can be 
utilized for Phase II - I would suggest the specfication for Phase II is 
completed in the very near future as the majority of the work in this is done 
in the very short term by the developers and it moves to the test team.

Please re-issue today.
