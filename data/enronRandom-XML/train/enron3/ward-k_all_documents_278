<true_name> Kim  </true_name> -

A couple of thoughts regarding <true_name> Charles Hinckley </true_name> 's email and your pending trip 
to San Diego:

1.  I have scoured all of United Technologies' filings and even their 
website.  I found exactly ZERO references to CalPeak Power, LLC.  I'm not 
saying that CalPeak ISN'T a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Technologies, 
but I find it strange that I can't find anything on CalPeak in United's 
filings/online info.  

2.  If CalPeak is indeed a subsidiary and WILL guarantee CalPeak's 
obligations, then we are in great shape.  United Technologies is A+ rated, 
with lots of liquidity available in the form of unused lines of credit.

3.  If CalPeak will not benefit from a United Technologies guaranty, then we 
definitely need to see their financials/management notes.

Will they send you the financials/notes before you leave for San Diego?

J. -

What's your take on this?  They want to meet with me on friday in San Diego 
to discuss a potential deal as we were short listed on the RFP to supply gas 
to the Calpeak power plants.  If we can't get credit established and 
contracts in their hands, I don't know if we want to waste our time - or 
money.  Let me know what you think ASAP.

Thanks,

<true_name> Kim

CalPeak Power, LLC is a project company and is now a wholly owned subisdiary
of Untited Technologies Corporation (NYSE: UTC).  UTC information is
available at www.utc.com, and from the commercial rating services.

It is not invisioned that CalPeak will benifit from an absolute gurantee
from UTC; however, some credit suport mechanism will be built into the
project and into the fuel supply agreements.
