The usual payment terms of PDVSA are 30 days after bill of lading.  We should 
pay Enron, who is our seller, 30 days after bill of lading plus monthly 
adjustments accordingly to market index movement.  We are better protected by 
paying as we did on the last cargo.  We should follow <true_name> Paul </true_name> 's recommendations 
which are being discussed with <true_name> Suzanne  </true_name> and her group.  

Our cash flow forecast shows that we will be short by $800M depending on the 
market index movements and after paying $397M of import tax, $156M of rent 
and $164M of property tax.

Subject: Re: <true_name> Next Cargo  

 </true_name> If we worked out a price structure similar to the last cargo, we could 
eliminate the price risk by paying the following for the LPG:

1400 MT at a Fixed Price (represents amount borrowed that went to <true_name> April  </true_name> sales)
2900 MT based on <true_name> May Mont Belvieu  </true_name> plus Premium 1
2800 MT based on <true_name> June Mont Belvieu  </true_name> plus Premium 2 and
2900 MT based on <true_name> July Mont Belvieu  </true_name> plus Premium 3

The Fixed Price for 1400 MT and the Premiums 1,2, and 3 are under discussion 
with <true_name> Suzanne </true_name> . This structure matches the cost of product with ProCaribe's 
sales revenue.

Question: How does ProCaribe get paid for the 15 days of product that goes 
with the Progasco sale?

Please explain how we will manage the price risk on this.  Remeber that we 
have to give 15 days worth of product with the sale of  Progas.  What are the 
payment terms?  How are you with cash?
