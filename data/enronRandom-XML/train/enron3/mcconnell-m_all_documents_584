<true_name> John </true_name> , 
You caught me.  I've been hit again with the bug, the 3rd time in November, 
and the combination of drugs has me wide awake.  I did promise <true_name> Chris  </true_name> that I 
wouldn't run off to the office when this occurs but she didn't tell me I 
couldn't do a lot of emails from home! - there is always a catch!

Actually I'm back to bed to try again after this one.  

Hope all is well in merry old England.

Cheers,
<true_name> Mike

please feel free to pass on my strong support.
