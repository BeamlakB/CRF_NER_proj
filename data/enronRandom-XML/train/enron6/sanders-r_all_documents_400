<true_name> Richard </true_name> ,

Have you received the check from Teldata?  I have our signed version of the 
settlement agreement dated 4/5 but I haven't received their executed copy.

Thanks,

<true_name> Andy

Hi <true_name> Andy </true_name> ,
Just checking on the status of the amount we're going to collect from 
Teldata.  Is it still around $450k?
Thanks,
