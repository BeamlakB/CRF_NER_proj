Sorry that I have been tied up recently and I am e-mailing this to you
because I misplaced your phone number.  In any event, we are involved in
some contractual price reopener discussions with Duke under our supply
contract with Duke.  In connection with those discussions, Duke has made
certain information requests which we are obligated to respond to.  These
discussions will ultimately lead to an arbitration.  One of the requests
relates to our downstream sales of the gas which ultimately goes to FPL.
If you need more information or would like to discuss this further, please
contact me at 713-853-6911.  Thanks again for your help.

<true_name> Jeff </true_name> ,  When I asked <true_name> Tony Altmann  </true_name> to sign the letter, he asked for more
detail than I could remember about why we are agreeing to do this.  Could
you provide me with that information.  I think you probably had this
conversation with Joe Step, but he is out of town today.  Thanks for your
help.
