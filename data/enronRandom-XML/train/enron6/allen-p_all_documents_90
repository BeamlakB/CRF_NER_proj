<true_name> Bob </true_name> ,

 Regarding <true_name> Patti Sullivan </true_name> 's contributions to the west desk this year, her 
efforts deserve recognition and a PBR award.  <true_name> Patti  </true_name> stepped up to fill the 
gap left by <true_name> Randy Gay </true_name> 's personal leave.  <true_name> Patti  </true_name> held together the scheduling 
group for about 2 month's by working 7days a week during this time.  <true_name> Patti 
 </true_name> was always the first one in the office during this time.  Frequently, she 
would be at work before 4 AM to prepare the daily operation package.  All the 
traders came to depend on the information <true_name> Patti  </true_name> provided.   This information 
has been extremely critical this year due to the pipeline explosion and size 
of the west desk positions.  
 Please call to discuss cash award.

<true_name> Phillip </true_name>
