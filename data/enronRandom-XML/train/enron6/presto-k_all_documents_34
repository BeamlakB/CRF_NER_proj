I sent this info as discussed to <true_name> Karen  </true_name> last week who prepared spreadsheet for 
Lavo.  I think the question now is how many and what will be the placement.  
I also have identified several needs for Summer Interns in Fundamentals and 
Realtime.  <true_name> Lloyd  </true_name> Will went through the resume book to pick summer interns for 
Fundamentals (provided you concur)  and the plan was to have <true_name> Rika  </true_name> use them 
for analytical work during the summer backfilling them with Strong AA's from 
the Fall group if needed.  <true_name> Juan Hernandez  </true_name> called me regarding adding a summer 
intern or two for the nightshift for confirmations etc. Just to let you know, 
I developed a spreadsheet with the help of <true_name> Lloyd  </true_name> and <true_name> Tom May  </true_name> outlining the 
entire Power team to track all our openings and help us orchestrate the 
movement of employees through power so the groups won't struggle with being 
short. This also will help all of our recruiters <true_name> Johnny </true_name> , <true_name> Charles </true_name> , <true_name> Karen 
Buckley  </true_name> and the program folks stay focused on our needs.

I would like 6 Analysts and 4 Associates.   I provided my top 20 wish list to 
Lavo last week.

Thanks.
