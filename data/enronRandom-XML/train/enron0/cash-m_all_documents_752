<true_name> Jeffrey </true_name> ,

We think that we will be in Austin from Sunday to Tuesday.  We made plans 
yesterday to spend Sunday evening with some friends from law school.  At some 
point, I will have lunch with <true_name> Maria Morris Stewart  </true_name> (my roommate from Tulane) 
who lives in Austin.  We still are free on Monday evening, if that works for 
you.  I think that we will stay at that Hawthorne Suites on MoPac, but we may 
splurge for the Four Seasons -- no firm plans as of yet!!

Of course, <true_name> Trey  </true_name> has to have his Hyde Park fix at soem point as well.

Let me know your plans.  Sooner would be better, because we are trying to 
finalize things.

<true_name> Michelle

Of course, I should also have asked for your new work number -- the last
number I have is for the old VC firm.

Would you please send that to me as well?

FYI:
My new work phone: 713-853-6935
New work e-mail: trey.cash@enron.com

Thanks,

<true_name> Trey

Can you send me your cell phone number again -- somehow we seem to have
misplaced it.

Thanks!
