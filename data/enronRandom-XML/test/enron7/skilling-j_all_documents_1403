Dear Mr. <true_name> Skilling </true_name> :

My name is <true_name> Tony Kishindo  </true_name> and I am the Senior Market Analyst for <true_name> DeWolff
Boberg  </true_name> and Associates. I am approaching you with hopes of scheduling some
time on your calendar for an introductory meeting between yourself and my
Vice President, <true_name> Scott Bein </true_name> .

The meeting is 45 minutes long and we are not looking for any sort of
commitment or decision at this point. We realize you may not be considering
the services of an outside resource, now or in the foreseeable future. We
non-the-less would appreciate the privilege of meeting with you, determining
the compatibility of our two firms, and earning a place in your Rolodex.
Regardless of the outcome of this meeting, we sincerely appreciate your
kindness and courtesy.

We offer our clients guaranteed process improvement and operations cost
reduction. We guarantee a 20% - 30% increase in production in as little as 8
months. The reason the results are so quick is because we are not technology
peddlers, we focus in on people, equipment and materials which we have found
to be any companies most valuable assets. We offer our clients a security
blanket when it comes to process improvement. Please feel free to visit our
home page at, www.dewolffboberg.com.

Thank you for your time, I look forward to scheduling 45 minutes of your
time at your nearest convenience.

Sincerely,

<true_name> Tony Kishindo
