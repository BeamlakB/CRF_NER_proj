<true_name> Kim </true_name> ,

Here's what you have to deal with at Mesa!  I'm gonna make one more run at 
this and she's alllllll yours.  Maybe we should meet in AZ some time in Feb., 
we can go see <true_name> Jan </true_name> , <true_name> Hutchens </true_name> , etc.  Does Tucson have any power shorts?  We're 
trying to sell a toll on LV-II and I thought they might be interested if they 
are short.

Your Friend,

<true_name> Dave

Subject: Today is January 24th





I am out of the office almost all day today; however, I wanted to let you 
know I
had a brief chat with <true_name> Dave Plumb </true_name> .  At this point, he does not think Enron is
offering us a good deal, mostly because the  -.30 is only on the half load and
not the total and originally in Deal One it was on the full load.  He did like
that the$4.25 had come down to $4.14.

I was set back a little by his next remark which was, "There is no hurry 
because
I want to take this to the Utilities Committee of Council and they don't meet
until next week."  I told him the numbers would change significantly if we
waited until February.  Again, he replied, "<true_name> Jan </true_name> , I want to take this to the
Utilities Committee anyway!!"  He also indicated about working within a range.
So probably tomorrow, I will put the pencil to the paper and try to make
something presentable for him to take to the Utilities Committee.  It will 
have
to be in layman's terms and easy to follow numbers because these guys don't 
deal
in this every day.  I am a little miffed that he thinks and wants to go to the
Committee first.  We have never done that before.  Usually we just get a deal
worked up, present it in an affirmative manner to the City Manager and he buys
off on it.  So we will see.  He is the boss!!

I am telling you all of this because I will probably be asking for your help 
to
make this in a presentable manner.

Talk to you later today or tomorrow for sure.  I am in the office all day
Thursday.

Thanks <true_name> Dave </true_name> ,

<true_name> Jan
