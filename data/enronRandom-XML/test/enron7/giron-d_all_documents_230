<true_name> Phillip Allen  </true_name> and <true_name> Keith Holst  </true_name> indicated that the curve changes in question 
for Socal was simply due to a higher forward market.  Let me know if you have 
any further questions.

<true_name> Jeff  </true_name> --

Before I send out the memo for January, I have a few questions about 3 curves 
that were reviewed this month.  Attached are Powerpoint slides containg the 
10 curves that were validated for January.  The ones I'm asking you to take a 
look at are:

1)  NGI-SOCAL -- Why the upshift for the entire curve compared to prior 
month?  Why has the shape of the curve changed from (approximately) 1/1/04 
forward compared to the curve from prior month?

2)  IF-MONCHY -- What factors account for differences between the 1/31/01 
curve vs. the 12/29/00 curve for the period between 1/1/01through 1/1/07?

3)  IF-TRANSCO Z3 --  What factors account for the entire curve changing so 
dramatically from last month to this month?



Thanks for your help.

<true_name> Jennifer
