Team,

Late last week, we were asked to provide a fuel oil specification sheet so 
fuel could be scheduled for the Site at Ft. Pierce.  The issue, currently, is 
we have three different specifications given to us over the past few months 
and are unsure which is correct.  The resolution:  we are reviewing the 
specifications from the air permit and specifications given to us from 
Mitsubishi to determine the minimum requirements, for the fuel, which we must 
meet for the air permit and gas turbine generator.  We anticipate this review 
process to be complete by the middle of this week.  If there are any 
questions, please feel free to contact me at 68258.

Thank you,
