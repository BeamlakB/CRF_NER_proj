<true_name> Mike </true_name> ,

This weekend, <true_name> Cole </true_name> , my thirteen year old, and I attended the birthday party 
for <true_name> Dorothy </true_name> 's five year old daughter, Caitland. What ever happended to the 
saying " the more things change, the more they remain the same"?  Things have 
definitely not stayed the same.

Anyway, <true_name> Dorothy  </true_name> asked about you and I encouraged her to call you, and I think 
she will.
