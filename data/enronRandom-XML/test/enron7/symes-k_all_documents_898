This was <true_name> Stan Cocke </true_name> 's deal, and since he just transferred into mid-marketing 
from real time, he's not used to putting the confimation request into his 
deals. This should be confirmed; but since the deal has already flowed, I 
wanted to check with you before changing anything. Please let me know.

Thanks,
<true_name> Kate

This deal is coded not to be confirmed, but it flows longer than 6 days which 
is the criteria for creating confirmations.  Can you check with the trader, 
and if it should be confirmed, get a contact and let me know.

Thanks!
