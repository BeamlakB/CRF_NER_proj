Hi <true_name> Pam </true_name> , 

Attached is an updated copy of the AESOP Program Participation Grid.  Felecia 
forwarded the voicemail to me from <true_name> Melissa Laing </true_name> .  She confirmed <true_name> Nowa Sarznya 
 </true_name> and <true_name> Trakya Elektrik </true_name> 's participation, but she did not confirm Enron's percent 
of ownership or whether they were consolidated or unconsolidated.  I also 
need information on Torpy Limited (EES) and Enron Energy Services Company 
Limited.  These  two companies were not listed in Secretariat.  I am still 
awaiting information from <true_name> Belinda McGaughy  </true_name> on the Wind and Zond Companies.  
Do you want me to contact them again or will you handle it?  Please advise.  

Thanks -- <true_name> LaQuitta
