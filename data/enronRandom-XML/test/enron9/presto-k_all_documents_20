The following is the understanding I have with <true_name> Chris Calger  </true_name> regarding <true_name> Scott 
Healy </true_name> 's involvement in East Power initiatives:

Since Auburndale is effectively dead, <true_name> Scott  </true_name> will no longer be involved on 
this project.
<true_name> Scott  </true_name> will support the Haywood, Georgia, & Calvert City development site 
sales through Q1 2001, with East Power getting 100% of the P&L value and 
<true_name> Scott Healy  </true_name> getting personal performance credit.   If <true_name> Ben  </true_name> elects to continue 
to use <true_name> Scott </true_name> 's services beyond Q1 2001, a value sharing agreement between 
<true_name> Ben </true_name> , <true_name> Calger  </true_name> and myself will have to be agreed upon.
<true_name> Jeff Ader  </true_name> will make a decision (after consultation with me) as to <true_name> Scott </true_name> 's 
continued involvement on the fuel cell tax monetization and Dighton 
restructuring project.   If <true_name> Jeff  </true_name> makes the decision that <true_name> Scott  </true_name> needs to 
remain actively involved in order to close the transaction, a value sharing 
agreement will be made between <true_name> Jeff </true_name> , <true_name> Calger </true_name> , and myself.    The value 
allocation % will be agreed upon upfront within the next week.   If a fair 
value sharing agreement cannot be reached, <true_name> Jeff  </true_name> will transition 
responsibility to another member of his origination team.

<true_name> Chris  </true_name> - Do you agree with the above description?
