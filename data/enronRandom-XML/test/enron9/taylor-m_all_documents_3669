Today I gave a presentation to the originators and traders in <true_name> Gary 
Hickerson </true_name> 's ag group, including a proposal of control procedures for 
compliance with ag option restrictions.  <true_name> Gary  </true_name> was not present, but the 
procedures were well received by the group, who felt that they were practical 
and could be complied with.

Attached is an outline of the presentation, including the proposed 
procedures.  -- <true_name> Bob
