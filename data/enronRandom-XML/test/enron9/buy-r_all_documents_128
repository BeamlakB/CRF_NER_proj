FYI.  <true_name> J Nowlan  </true_name> said he followed up with a call to Henkka and was left fairly 
confused as to why he suggested <true_name> K Beasley  </true_name> and <true_name> G Novokovic  </true_name> should not be 
involved.  <true_name> Ted </true_name> , pass on to <true_name> Sally  </true_name> et al as you see fit.

FYI.  I suggested J <true_name> Nowlan  </true_name> speak with you directly about this as he has since 
spoken with Henkka.

 </true_name> Good Morning,


I spoke with Ilkka yesterday (prior to <true_name> Robert Quick  </true_name> prohibiting to speak to
him.)  He asked me to deliver to <true_name> John Nowlan  </true_name> the following message:

Regarding the Vneshtoprom case, if he is let to, he is willing to come to work
solely to try to sort out Vneshtoprom's debt to Enron. He thinks that in a 
month
he has either been able to get Vneshtoprom pay back the prepayment money or at
least gotten an original signed statement from them that how big the debt is 
and
a schedule to return the money.  After the job is done he would then leave the
company with whatever terms and conditions you guys would then sort out 
between
yourselves. If he is let to try to sort out the Vneshtopron debt, he wants to 
do
it without <true_name> Kevin Beasley </true_name> 's or <true_name> Goran Novokovic </true_name> 's help.

The feeling I got was that he is ready to negotiate this thing as quckly as
possible to an end.

I hope I have been able to summarize his thoughts in that way that you would 
at
least have a conversation with him. I think his orders are at the moment to 
sit
home and wait for <true_name> Kevin </true_name> 's call.

The way I personally see the Vneshtoprom case is that without Ilkka's help 
there
is nobody who can do anything to help Enron get any money back. Whatever
happened last friday in Moscow, whatever accusations where made by 
Vneshtoprom,
I personally feel that the only reason for all that was to get Ilkka out of 
the
picture.
